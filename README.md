## Hypothesis: 
Homeobox genes are required for specification and differentiation of retinal cells. The expression patterns of Hox genes change over the course of chicken retinal development, with significant shifts anticipated at key stages such as E8, E16, and E18, when whole retinas were harvested. Additionally, at E18, when whole corneas were collected alongside retinas, distinct gene expression profiles may emerge, reflecting the coordinated orchestration of retinal and corneal development processes.

## Data availability:
Data is available in GEO under the accession number GSE65938.
