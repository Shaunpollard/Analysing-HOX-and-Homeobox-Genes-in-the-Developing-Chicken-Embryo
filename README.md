Welcome to my 2024 Advanced Next Generation Sequencing Data project. In this study, I investigate changes in the transcriptome of the chicken retina and cornea.

The retina and cornea are vital components of avian vision, influencing how chickens perceive their surroundings. Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying their development and function is crucial for various fields, including developmental biology, ophthalmology, and evolutionary genetics.

Using advanced sequencing techniques, I analyze the gene expression patterns in these ocular tissues to uncover the genetic factors shaping their development and maintenance. By examining the chicken genome, I aim to elucidate the molecular processes driving the formation and function of the avian visual system.

## Hypothesis: 
Homeobox genes are required for specification and differentiation of retinal cells. The expression patterns of Hox genes change over the course of chicken retinal development, with significant shifts anticipated at key stages such as E8, E16, and E18, when whole retinas were harvested. Additionally, at E18, when whole corneas were collected alongside retinas, distinct gene expression profiles may emerge, reflecting the coordinated orchestration of retinal and corneal development processes.

## Data availability:
Data is available in GEO under the accession number GSE65938.
